# ART Area Director
See also general expertise for all area directors.

ART ADs are expected to take a lead role, guiding the community in the making of critical decisions about the scope of the IETF's applications-layer protocol work. Because of the breadth of the ART Area, the ART ADs need to deal with a large set of application-layer protocols, including many with which a particular AD may not have direct experience.

This description is careful to talk about the set of ART ADs as a collective, with a collective set of skills. No one AD will have all of them, and it would be best to look at a balanced skill set across the ART ADs. A generalist with good management skills and good working relationships within the community will be more successful than a narrow specialist.

The ART Area works on the application layer and related protocols:

- Real-time applications. These are protocols that enable interactive human-to-human communication (see RFC 3550). Groups in this category are working on things such as real-time web communications, teleconferencing, emergency services communication, internet telephony, and instant messaging.
- Traditional applications. These are the protocols we've generally thought of in relation to the application layer. They include such things as email, calendaring, directory services, provisioning and access protocols related to DNS and IP and support for constrained environments.
- Application building blocks. These are designed to be used with a variety of more specific applications. They include compression, codecs, internationalization; JSON, XML, and CBOR; media types; URNs; and URI schemes.

The ART Area often discusses whether something is properly the realm of the IETF or "belongs" to other SDOs, as a result, the set of ART ADs needs to include the ability and experience to relate to a wide range of non-IETF organizations, such as the W3C, WHATWG, 3GPP, and the Unicode Consortium.

It is important that for each of the following there be at least one AD with some understanding of it and an ability to find and leverage expertise on it when needed: internationalization; URI schemes; SIP, SDP and related services; RTP; media types; and email.

Cross-area expertise with the Security and Web and Internet Transport Areas is also useful, as there are often dependencies between ART work and those areas, particularly with respect to authentication, confidentiality, privacy, network congestion issues, and newly evolving work in the Web and Internet Transport Area.

ART ADs should be prepared to spend 50-75% of their time on IESG-related activities.

ART ADs maintain and support the ART Area Review Team (artart). ARTART provides reviews on request and during Last Call that can be used by the ADs as input for their ballot positions.

The ADs may delegate any tasks that can be delegated, but the ADs themselves still have the ultimate responsibility to ensure that ART Area considerations are appropriately taken into account during IESG Evaluation.
